## miners.json
Tip: When disabling algorithm, set the DAG value of the algorithm that you want to disable to `2147483647`, **DO NOT SET IT TO 0, -1 OR NULL** or else SaladBind will think that the algorithm is compatible because the GPU VRAM is higher than `0 or -1` or doesn't have a requirement `null`.

Algorithm  | Mineable | Get dag source from |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Ethash  | ❌ (as of 15 September 2022) | 2147483647 (unmineable)
| Etchash |  ✅ | https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator
| KawPow |  ✅ | https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator
| Autolykos2 | ✅ | https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator
| Octopus | ✅ | 7gb (estimated, this algorithm grows at least 1-1.5gb a year)
| BeamV3 (EQUI150-5)| ✅ | 2gb
| ZHash (EQUI144-5) | ✅ | 2gb
| Zelhash* (EQUI125-4) | ✅ | 2gb
| RandomX | ✅ | DAG not required
| Ghostrider | ✅ | DAG not required

*Zcash or Zelhash is not enabled in SaladBind because it hasn't been tested yet™️, to enable it, change the supported algorithm in compatible miner at miners.json if you wish to use it. (Only Nicehash pool is supported.)

## Announcement.json
If your going to make your own announcement, increment the number in "number" by 1, It not that important. :)

*You can put anything in the number value, like `"number": "UhhAaron/SaladBind - Issued 1"` but it will show `Annoucement - No.UhhAaron/SaladBind - Issued 1`.*

### Tip
* When writing announcements, it is recommended that you don't use [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) 🔧📜🛠️⚠️🎉✅🐛🩹, or at least don't overuse it as some OS don't support emoji or have certain emoji.)

* When editing a JSON file, it is recommended that you use IDE or a JSON Validator.
